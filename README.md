# protocol-assistant
A smart document helper for clinical trial teams - like "Grammarly for clinical
 trials" that helps create better study documents without changing how people work.

## Overview

Protocol Assistant is a low-friction web application that provides instant feedback
 on clinical trial protocols, informed consent forms, and other study documents.
 Simply paste your text and get immediate suggestions for improvements, consistency
 checks, and regulatory compliance scoring.

## Value Proposition

- **Immediate Value**: Get feedback in seconds, not days
  
- **No Training Required**: Intuitive copy-paste interface
  
- **No System Changes**: Works alongside existing tools
  
- **No PHI/PII Risk**: Works with template documents
  
- **Individual Adoption**: One person can start using it today
  
  ## Features
  
  ### üîç Protocol Quality Checks
  
- **Consistency Validation**: Finds contradictions and inconsistencies within
  protocols
  
- **Compliance Scoring**: Rates protocol against ICH-GCP and FDA requirements
  
- **Logic Validation**: Ensures inclusion/exclusion criteria make logical sense
  
  ### üìö Document Enhancement
  
- **Reading Level Analysis**: Ensures consent forms are at appropriate grade level
  (8th grade standard)
  
- **Auto-Glossary Generation**: Creates glossaries from medical terms in documents
  
- **FAQ Generation**: Automatically generates FAQs from common protocol questions
  
- **Synopsis Creation**: Auto-generates protocol synopsis from full protocol
  
  ### üè• Feasibility Assessment
  
- **Site Feasibility Scoring**: Evaluates if sites can realistically execute the
  protocol
  
- **Burden Calculator**: Estimates time commitment for participants
