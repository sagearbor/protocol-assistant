  ## Technical Decisions to Make
  
  ### Frontend
  
- [ ] React vs. Vue vs. Angular â†’ Recommend: **Next.js (React)**
  
- [ ] UI Library â†’ Recommend: **Tailwind + Radix UI**
  
- [ ] State Management â†’ Recommend: **Zustand or Context API**
  
  ### Backend/Integration
  
- [ ] Direct MCP calls vs. API Gateway â†’ Recommend: **API Gateway for caching**
  
- [ ] Authentication method â†’ Recommend: **Azure AD with MSAL**
  
- [ ] File handling â†’ Recommend: **Parse locally, never store**
  
  ### Deployment
  
- [ ] Hosting platform â†’ Recommend: **Azure App Service**
  
- [ ] CDN â†’ Recommend: **Azure Front Door**
  
- [ ] Monitoring â†’ Recommend: **Application Insights**
  
  ## Risk Mitigation
  
  | Risk | Mitigation |
  | --- | --- |
  | MCP server downtime | Cache results, show degraded functionality |
  | Large document processing | Chunk processing, show progressive results |
  | User adoption | Start with power users, iterate based on feedback |
  | Security concerns | Never store documents, process in memory only |
  
  ## Notes
  

- Start with Protocol focus, add ICF and other documents later
  
- Prioritize speed - users should see value in < 30 seconds
  
- Keep it simple - resist feature creep in Phase 1
  
- Get to users ASAP - deploy Phase 1 internally for feedback
  
  These documents provide a complete foundation for starting the Protocol Assistant
  project, with clear goals, technical architecture, and a phased development approach
  that ensures quick wins while building toward a comprehensive solution
